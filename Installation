1. Make Sure you've installed all the Dependencies mentioned in the "requirements.txt". It is preferred to work in virtualenv to keep your dependencies separate from other projects.

2. Create a virtual environment and run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the dependencies.

3. The Project directory tree is listed below
── Aspose
    ├── aspose_task
    │   └── aspose_task
    │       └── spiders
    └── aspose_web
        ├── aspose_web
        └── extensions
            ├── migrations
            └── templates
                └── extensions

4. First, we need to crawl the "http://file.org/sitemap.html" using Scrapy. It has been customised to store the scraped data as Django model Object. make sure you're in the scrapy project directory i.e Aspose/asopose_task and run the command "scrapy crawl extensions"

5. The Scraped data will be stored as Django model object for our web application. After the crawler has crawled all the extensions data, move to the folder
Aspose>aspose_web.

6. This is our web-application open command line tool here and runs the command "python manage.py runserver" to run the application.
